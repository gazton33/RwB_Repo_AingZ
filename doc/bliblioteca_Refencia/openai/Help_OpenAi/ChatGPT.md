What is ChatGPT?
Commonly asked questions about ChatGPT
Updated over 5 months ago
How much does it cost to use ChatGPT?
ChatGPT is free to use, though we do have subscription plans available, available on our pricing page.
How does ChatGPT work?
ChatGPT is fine-tuned from GPT-3.5, a language model trained to produce text. ChatGPT was optimized for dialogue by using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) – a method that uses human demonstrations and preference comparisons to guide the model toward desired behavior.
Why does the AI seem so real and lifelike?
These models were trained on vast amounts of data from the internet written by humans, including conversations, so the responses it provides may sound human-like. Outputs may be inaccurate, untruthful, and otherwise misleading at times.
Can I trust that the AI is telling me the truth?
ChatGPT is not connected to the internet, and it can occasionally produce incorrect answers. It has limited knowledge of world and events after 2021 and may also occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content.
We'd recommend checking whether responses from the model are accurate or not. If you find an answer is incorrect, please provide that feedback by using the "Thumbs Down" button.
Who can view my conversations?
As part of our commitment to safe and responsible AI, we review conversations to improve our systems and to ensure the content complies with our policies and safety requirements.
Will you use my conversations for training?
When you use our services for individuals such as ChatGPT, we may use your content to train our models. You can opt out of training through our privacy portal by clicking on “do not train on my content,” or to turn off training for your ChatGPT conversations, follow the instructions in our Data Controls FAQ. Once you opt out, new conversations will not be used to train our models.
We don’t use content from our business offerings such as ChatGPT Team or ChatGPT Enterprise to train our models. Please see our Enterprise Privacy page for information on how we handle business data.
Can you delete my data?
Yes, please follow the data deletion process.
Can you delete specific prompts?
No, we are not able to delete specific prompts from your history. Please don't share any sensitive information in your conversations.
Can I see my history of threads? How can I save a conversation I’ve had?
Yes, you can now view and continue your past conversations.
Where do you save my personal and conversation data?
For more information on how we handle data, please see our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.
How can I implement this? Is there any implementation guide for this?
Developers can now integrate ChatGPT into their applications and products through our API. Users can expect continuous model improvements and the option to choose dedicated capacity for deeper control over the models. To learn more, please check out the documentation here.
Do I need a new account if I already have a Labs or Playground account?
If you have an existing account at labs.openai.com or platform.openai.com, then you can login directly at chatgpt.com using the same login information. If you don't have an account, you'll need to sign-up for a new account at chatgpt.com.
Why did ChatGPT give me an answer that’s not related to my question?
ChatGPT will occasionally make up facts or “hallucinate” outputs. If you find an answer is unrelated, please provide that feedback by using the "Thumbs Down" button
Can I use output from ChatGPT for commercial uses?
Subject to the Content Policy and Terms, you own the output you create with ChatGPT, including the right to reprint, sell, and merchandise – regardless of whether output was generated through a free or paid plan.
I accidentally provided incorrect information during sign-up and now I'm unable to complete the process. How can I fix this issue?
Please reach out to our support team by initiating a new conversation using the on-site chat tool at help.openai.com. We'll be happy to help!

June 13, 2025
Improvements to the ChatGPT search response quality
We’ve upgraded ChatGPT search for all users to provide even more comprehensive, up-to-date responses. In testing, we found users preferred these search improvements over our previous search experience.
Improved quality
Smarter responses that are more intelligent, are better at understanding what you’re asking, and provide more comprehensive answers.
Handles longer conversational contexts, allowing better intelligence in longer conversations.
Improved search capability and instruction following
More robust ability to follow instructions, especially in longer conversations, significantly reducing repetitive responses.
Capability to run multiple searches automatically for complex or difficult questions.
Search the web using an image you’ve uploaded.
Known limitations
Users may notice longer responses with this new search experience.
In some cases, a “chain of thought” reasoning will show up unexpectedly for simple queries. A fix for this is rolling out to users shortly.
ChatGPT may still make occasional mistakes - please double check responses.
June 12, 2025
Expanded Model Support for Custom GPTs
Creators can now choose from the full set of ChatGPT models (GPT-4o, o3, o4-mini and more) when building Custom GPTs—making it easier to fine-tune performance for different tasks, industries, and workflows. Creators can also set a recommended model to guide users.

Learn more about projects.
\*Memory improvements are available for Plus and Pro users.
June 10, 2025
Today, we're launching OpenAI o3-pro—available now for Pro users in ChatGPT and in our API.
Like o1-pro, o3-pro is a version of our most intelligent model, o3, designed to think longer and provide the most reliable responses. Since the launch of o1-pro, users have favored this model for domains such as math, science, and coding—areas where o3-pro continues to excel, as shown in academic evaluations. Like o3, o3-pro has access to tools that make ChatGPT useful—it can search the web, analyze files, reason about visual inputs, use Python, personalize responses using memory, and more. Because o3-pro has access to tools, responses typically take longer than o1-pro to complete. We recommend using it for challenging questions where reliability matters more than speed, and waiting a few minutes is worth the tradeoff.
In expert evaluations, reviewers consistently prefer o3-pro over o3 in every tested category and especially in key domains like science, education, programming, business, and writing help. Reviewers also rated o3-pro consistently higher for clarity, comprehensiveness, instruction-following, and accuracy.
Academic evaluations show that o3-pro consistently outperforms both o1-pro and o3.
To assess the key strength of o3-pro, we once again use our rigorous "4/4 reliability" evaluation, where a model is considered successful only if it correctly answers a question in all four attempts, not just one:
o3-pro is available in the model picker for Pro and Team users starting today, replacing o1-pro. Enterprise and Edu users will get access the week after.
As o3-pro uses the same underlying model as o3, full safety details can be found in the o3 system card.
Limitations
At the moment, temporary chats are disabled for o3-pro as we resolve a technical issue.
Image generation is not supported within o3-pro—please use GPT-4o, OpenAI o3, or OpenAI o4-mini to generate images.
Canvas is also currently not supported within o3-pro.
June 7, 2025
Updates to Advanced Voice Mode for paid users
We're upgrading Advanced Voice in ChatGPT for paid users with significant enhancements in intonation and naturalness, making interactions feel more fluid and human-like. When we first launched Advanced Voice, it represented a leap forward in AI speech—now, it speaks even more naturally, with subtler intonation, realistic cadence (including pauses and emphases), and more on-point expressiveness for certain emotions including empathy, sarcasm, and more.
Voice also now offers intuitive and effective language translation. Just ask Voice to translate between languages, and it will continue translating throughout your conversation until you tell it to stop or switch. It’s ready to translate whenever you need it—whether you're asking for directions in Italy or chatting with a colleague from the Tokyo office. For example, at a restaurant in Brazil, Voice can translate your English sentences into Portuguese, and the waiter’s Portuguese responses back into English—making conversations effortless, no matter where you are or who you're speaking with.
This upgrade to Advanced Voice is available for all paid users across markets and platforms—just tap the Voice icon in the message composer to get started.
This update is in addition to improvements we made earlier this year to ensure fewer interruptions and improved accents.
Known Limitations
In testing, we've observed that this update may occasionally cause minor decreases in audio quality, including unexpected variations in tone and pitch. These issues are more noticeable with certain voice options. We expect to improve audio consistency over time.
Additionally, rare hallucinations in Voice Mode persist with this update, resulting in unintended sounds resembling ads, gibberish, or background music. We are actively investigating these issues and working toward a solution.

Sunsetting Monday GPT
Launched on April 1 as a one-month surprise, our “Monday” personality (available in both voice and text) has now been sunset. We hope you enjoyed Monday's irreverent style, and we’re already working on new personalities for future use. Please stay tuned for what’s next!
April 29, 2025
Updates to GPT-4o
We've reverted the most recent update to GPT-4o due to issues with overly agreeable responses (sycophancy).
We’re actively working on further improvements. For more details, check out our blog post explaining what happened and our initial findings, and this blog post where we expand on what we missed with sycophancy and the changes we're going to make going forward.
April 25, 2025
Improvements to GPT-4o
We’re making additional improvements to GPT-4o, optimizing when it saves memories and enhancing problem-solving capabilities for STEM. We’ve also made subtle changes to the way it responds, making it more proactive and better at guiding conversations toward productive outcomes. We think these updates help GPT-4o feel more intuitive and effective across a variety of tasks–we hope you agree!
April 16, 2025
o3 and o4-mini in ChatGPT
Today, we’re releasing OpenAI o3 and o4-mini, the latest in our o-series of models trained to think for longer before responding. These are the smartest models we’ve released to date, representing a step change in ChatGPT's capabilities for everyone from curious users to advanced researchers. For the first time, our reasoning models can agentically use and combine every tool within ChatGPT—this includes searching the web, analyzing uploaded files and other data with Python, reasoning deeply about visual inputs, and even generating images. Critically, these models are trained to reason about when and how to use tools to produce detailed and thoughtful answers in the right output formats, typically in under a minute, to solve more complex problems. This allows them to tackle multi-faceted questions more effectively, a step toward a more agentic ChatGPT that can independently execute tasks on your behalf. The combined power of state-of-the-art reasoning with full tool access translates into significantly stronger performance across academic benchmarks and real-world tasks, setting a new standard in both intelligence and usefulness.
Memory with Search
ChatGPT can also use memories to inform search queries when ChatGPT searches the web using third-party search providers. Learn more about search.
April 15, 2025
ChatGPT Image Library
All images you create with ChatGPT are now automatically saved to a new Library in the sidebar, giving you one place to browse, revisit, and reuse your work without digging through past conversations. The Library is rolling out today on Web, iOS, and Android for Free, Plus, and Pro users (Enterprise / Edu support coming soon). For now, it displays images generated with 4o Image Generation while we backfill older creations, and you can remove an image by deleting the conversation where it was made.
April 10, 2025
Sunsetting GPT‑4 in ChatGPT
Effective  April  30,  2025, GPT‑4 will be retired from ChatGPT and fully replaced by GPT‑4o.
GPT‑4o is our newer, natively multimodal model. In head‑to‑head evaluations it consistently surpasses GPT‑4 in writing, coding, STEM, and more.
Recent upgrades have further improved GPT‑4o’s instruction following, problem solving, and conversational flow, making it a natural successor to GPT‑4.
GPT-4 will still be available in the API.
GPT‑4 marked a pivotal moment in ChatGPT’s evolution. We’re grateful for the breakthroughs it enabled and for the feedback that helped shape its successor. GPT‑4o builds on that foundation to deliver even greater capability, consistency, and creativity.
March 27, 2025
We’ve made improvements to GPT-4o—it now feels more intuitive, creative, and collaborative, with enhanced instruction-following, smarter coding capabilities, and a clearer communication style.
Smarter problem-solving in STEM and coding:
GPT-4o has further improved its capability to tackle complex technical and coding problems. It now generates cleaner, simpler frontend code, more accurately thinks through existing code to identify necessary changes, and consistently produces coding outputs that successfully compile and run, streamlining your coding workflows.
Enhanced instruction-following and formatting accuracy:
GPT-4o is now more adept at following detailed instructions, especially for prompts containing multiple or complex requests. It improves on generating outputs according to the format requested and achieves higher accuracy in classification tasks.
“Fuzzy” improvements:
Early testers say that the model seems to better understand the implied intent behind their prompts, especially when it comes to creative and collaborative tasks. It’s also slightly more concise and clear, using fewer markdown hierarchies and emojis for responses that are easier to read, less cluttered, and more focused. We're curious to see if our users also find this to be the case.
This model is now available in ChatGPT and in the API as the newest snapshot of chatgpt-4o-latest. We plan to bring these improvements to a dated model in the API in the coming weeks.
March 18, 2025

A personal AI analyst for business users and experienced data professionals
Updated over 12 months ago
Interacting with tables in ChatGPT
When you upload a file, ChatGPT will automatically create an interactive table view that allows you to scroll through your data and view all of your rows and columns.
Once the file is uploaded, you can follow up with questions pertaining to the dataset. The prompts do not need to specify specific operations - natural language commands like “analyze” or “compare” are sufficient for producing results from ChatGPT.
You can also create tables natively in ChatGPT by requesting that the output is generated as a table.
To get a better look at your data, you can expand the table by clicking on the two arrows on the top-right corner of the table:
In the table view, you can select a specific row or column and create a prompt to obtain insights about the data highlighted. For example, here we have selected a column and asked for the item that appears most frequently.
Multiple rows or columns can be selected by pressing and holding the Command key on Mac or the Ctrl key on Windows and clicking on the rows or columns. Multiple cells can also be selected by clicking on one cells and dragging the mouse to cover the intended area.
After selecting multiple items, you can ask ChatGPT to calculate a value or perform an action on the values of the selected. For instance, you can highlight a set of cells and ask ChatGPT to compute the average value.
Editing and creating tables with ChatGPT
You can upload and edit your existing tables by prompting ChatGPT to make updates. For example, you can prompt ChatGPT to update a table with a column containing the average values.
You can prompt ChatGPT to make specific changes by highlighting the columns, rows, or cells that you want the updates based on. Here, we have highlighted two of the columns and requested a new column to the table that contains their sums.
You can download the table generated by ChatGPT by clicking on the download button on the top-right corner of the table. Please note that the downloaded file will be in a CSV format.
Visualizing your data with ChatGPT
After uploading a file, you can prompt ChatGPT to produce a static chart. You can allow ChatGPT to determine the ideal chart type for the dataset, or specify one of our supported chart types in your prompt: line graph, bar chart, pie chart, histograms, scatter plot, box plots (Box-and-Whisker Plots), heat maps, area charts, radar charts, treemaps, bubble charts, and waterfall charts.
Please note that only bar, pie, scatter, and line charts are currently interactive in most cases.
If no chart type is specified, ChatGPT will determine the ideal chart type to output.
On the top-right corner of the chart, you can download or expand the size of the chart. By default, downloaded charts are in a PNG format.
You can also make edits to chart colors or toggle its interactivity on or off. When changing colors, you can select one of our default colors or input the hex code of a color.
Common types of analysis
ChatGPT is trained to perform a variety of data analysis tasks. Some common tasks include:
Anomaly detection and mitigation
When making decisions with data, it’s important to ensure that your source data is as accurate as possible. ChatGPT knows how to identify data which might be missing or incorrect. Common issues ChatGPT can identify and repair include:
Missing values
Outlier values
Duplicate rows
Incorrect data types
Start your analysis with a prompt like this: Check this data for common issues.
Once ChatGPT has identified common issues, you can ask it to fix those issues. Depending on the issues encountered, ChatGPT may offer multiple options for you to choose from. If you’re uncertain about the implications of these choices, try asking ChatGPT for more information.
Aggregation & integration
ChatGPT can aggregate large amounts of structured data to help you make sense of information. Some aggregations ChatGPT can perform include:
Sums
Averages (median, mean, mode)
Minimum and maximum values
Counts of distinct values
Standard deviation
You can expand a table and select one or more numerical columns, and then use a prompt like this: Calculate the median and standard deviation for this data.
ChatGPT can also merge multiple datasets together based on shared identifiers.
Let’s say you upload two spreadsheets, one containing customers and one containing purchases. Purchase records are associated with customer records via a customer\_id property. ChatGPT knows how to integrate both files into a single dataset so that it can answer questions like "What is the total of all purchases made by customers with a gold plan?”
ChatGPT automatically merges datasets for you when you ask a question where it is required.
Advanced statistical analysis
ChatGPT understands how to perform a wide variety of statistical analyses, and is able to select appropriate techniques based on your requirements. Some types of analyses ChatGPT can perform include:
Comparative statistics: This involves comparing different groups or variables to understand their differences or similarities. Techniques include t-tests, ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), and MANOVA (Multivariate Analysis of Variance).
Correlation and regression Analysis: These methods assess the relationship between variables. Correlation analysis measures the strength and direction of the relationship, while regression analysis models the relationship to predict outcomes.
Time Series analysis: This type of analysis examines data points collected over time to identify trends, cycles, and seasonal effects. Methods include ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and Seasonal Decomposition.
You don’t need to be a data scientist to use these techniques! If you’re not sure which technique is most appropriate for your data, try telling ChatGPT what you want to understand, and ask it to recommend the best analysis technique. If you’re not sure how to interpret the output of the analysis, ask ChatGPT to explain it to you. An effective prompt can be: Is there anything notable or unusual about this analysis?

Include descriptive column headers in the first row
Use plain language for column headers, avoiding acronyms and jargon
Use one row per record
Don’t:
Include multiple sections and tables in a single spreadsheet
Include empty rows or columns
Include images which contain critical information
How does ChatGPT analyze and visualize data with charts?
ChatGPT uses pandas to analyze your data and Matplotlib to create both static and interactive charts with your data. After using ChatGPT to analyze or visualize your data, click on the View Analysis link that appears at the end of the response to see how ChatGPT used these tools:
How can I see the analysis by default?
After using ChatGPT to analyze or visualize your data, click on the View Analysis link that appears at the end of the response.
At the top of the modal, you can toggle “Always show details” on so that the analysis window appears by default after every response.
If you would like to use the code locally, you can click on “Copy” to copy the code to your clipboard and paste it into your code editor.
How do I enable interactive charts?
After generating a chart, select "Switch to interactive chart" on the top-right corner of the graph.
After selecting this option, the graph will re-render an update to an interactive version of your graph. Please note that a limited set of chart types are interactive.
You can switch back to a static graph by selecting "Switch to static chart" on the top-right corner of the graph.
What chart types are interactive?
Currently, only bar, pie, scatter, and line charts are currently interactive in most cases.
ChatGPT can produce a variety of non-interactive charts, including: histograms, scatter plot, box plots (Box-and-Whisker Plots), heat maps, area charts, radar charts, treemaps, bubble charts, and waterfall charts.
How many files can I analyze at once?
Up to 10 files can be uploaded to a given conversation
Up to 20 files can be attached to a GPT as Knowledge (ChatGPT can interact with these files if the Code Interpreter capability is enabled at the GPT level)
How much data can I analyze?
512 MB per file. For CSV files or spreadsheets, the file size cannot exceed approximately 50MB, depending on the size of each row.
This makes ChatGPT a good solution for working with data files which are too large to open in a spreadsheet application.
How do I delete files I upload?
Files uploaded to Advanced Data Analysis are deleted within a duration that varies based on your plan. If you are encountering your file usage cap, you can also delete files from recent chats or from any GPTs that you built, as these share caps.
Which models support Advanced Data Analysis?
What’s going on under the hood?
When you upload structured data, ChatGPT starts by examining the first few rows of data to understand the schema and types of values which may exist.
When you ask questions about your data, ChatGPT performs the following steps:
Access the uploaded data in a code execution environment
Write Python code to process the data and produce the required analytical output
Execute code and examine the results
Integrate the results into the response you see in the chat window
It is ChatGPT’s ability to both write and execute code that enables it to perform complex mathematical operations and statistical analysis techniques. If you would like to examine the code which ChatGPT generated, click on the blue [>\_] link at the end of a message.
How does ChatGPT know how to analyze data?
One of ChatGPT’s core capabilities is the ability to perform complex analysis based on natural language prompts. In order to make this work, GPT-4 (the frontier model which powers ChatGPT) was post-trained on a large volume of data analysis tasks. After being exposed to example datasets, natural language questions about those datasets, and the code data analysts wrote to answer those questions, the model is now able to generate new code to perform novel analyses. This is why ChatGPT “knows” how to use specialized Python libraries to perform complex tasks.
How does ChatGPT execute code?
When analyzing data, ChatGPT gets access to a secure code execution environment. The environment is pre-loaded with hundreds of Python libraries, and ChatGPT knows how to write code to import and use these libraries. The environment has access to files which are attached to the ChatGPT prompt, which allows it to interact with the structured data you upload. The environment can also access files which are retrieved using GPT Actions.
When ChatGPT generates code in response to your prompt, it passes that code to the environment for execution. It then has access to environment outputs, including any errors produced by the generated code. ChatGPT is able to interpret errors and resolve issues with the generated code automatically.
The ChatGPT code execution environment is unable to generate outbound network requests directly. Code execution is also isolated from the rest of the ChatGPT hosting platform, which ensures the safety of the feature.
When ChatGPT analyzes data for the first time during a conversation, a new instance of the code execution environment is generated. This instance is only accessible from within the associated conversation, and is destroyed within 13 hours of the conversation becoming inactive.
What are some applications outside of data analysis?
ChatGPT’s code execution environment is primarily designed for interacting with structured data. However, the core capabilities of the feature (writing and executing code, accessing the output of code execution) enable a wide variety of applications outside of data analysis.
Applications include:
File manipulation and generation
Thematic analysis of unstructured data and text documents
etc.
ChatGPT is trained on a variety of coding tasks, and can come up with creative ways to use the code execution environment to accomplish tasks.

Model Release Notes
Updated over 3 weeks ago
Launching OpenAI o3-pro—available now for Pro users in ChatGPT and in our API (June 10, 2025)
Like o1-pro, o3-pro is a version of our most intelligent model, o3, designed to think longer and provide the most reliable responses. Since the launch of o1-pro, users have favored this model for domains such as math, science, and coding—areas where o3-pro continues to excel, as shown in academic evaluations. Like o3, o3-pro has access to tools that make ChatGPT useful—it can search the web, analyze files, reason about visual inputs, use Python, personalize responses using memory, and more. Because o3-pro has access to tools, responses typically take longer than o1-pro to complete. We recommend using it for challenging questions where reliability matters more than speed, and waiting a few minutes is worth the tradeoff.
In expert evaluations, reviewers consistently prefer o3-pro over o3 in every tested category and especially in key domains like science, education, programming, business, and writing help. Reviewers also rated o3-pro consistently higher for clarity, comprehensiveness, instruction-following, and accuracy.
Academic evaluations show that o3-pro consistently outperforms both o1-pro and o3.
To assess the key strength of o3-pro, we once again use our rigorous "4/4 reliability" evaluation, where a model is considered successful only if it correctly answers a question in all four attempts, not just one:
o3-pro is available in the model picker for Pro and Team users starting today, replacing o1-pro. Enterprise and Edu users will get access the week after.
As o3-pro uses the same underlying model as o3, full safety details can be found in the o3 system card.
Limitations
At the moment, temporary chats are disabled for o3-pro as we resolve a technical issue.
Image generation is not supported within o3-pro—please use GPT-4o, OpenAI o3, or OpenAI o4-mini to generate images.
Canvas is also currently not supported within o3-pro.
Updates to Advanced Voice Mode for paid users (June 7, 2025)
We're upgrading Advanced Voice in ChatGPT for paid users with significant enhancements in intonation and naturalness, making interactions feel more fluid and human-like. When we first launched Advanced Voice, it represented a leap forward in AI speech—now, it speaks even more naturally, with subtler intonation, realistic cadence (including pauses and emphases), and more on-point expressiveness for certain emotions including empathy, sarcasm, and more.
Voice also now offers intuitive and effective language translation. Just ask Voice to translate between languages, and it will continue translating throughout your conversation until you tell it to stop or switch. It’s ready to translate whenever you need it—whether you're asking for directions in Italy or chatting with a colleague from the Tokyo office. For example, at a restaurant in Brazil, Voice can translate your English sentences into Portuguese, and the waiter’s Portuguese responses back into English—making conversations effortless, no matter where you are or who you're speaking with.
This upgrade to Advanced Voice is available for all paid users across markets and platforms—just tap the Voice icon in the message composer to get started.
This update is in addition to improvements we made earlier this year to ensure fewer interruptions and improved accents.
Known Limitations
In testing, we've observed that this update may occasionally cause minor decreases in audio quality, including unexpected variations in tone and pitch. These issues are more noticeable with certain voice options. We expect to improve audio consistency over time.
Additionally, rare hallucinations in Voice Mode persist with this update, resulting in unintended sounds resembling ads, gibberish, or background music. We are actively investigating these issues and working toward a solution.
Update to o4-mini (June 6, 2025)
We are rolling back an o4-mini snapshot, that we deployed less than a week ago and intended to improve the length of model responses, because our automated monitoring tools detected an increase in content flags.
Releasing GPT-4.1 in ChatGPT for all paid users (May 14, 2025)
Since its launch in the API in April, GPT-4.1 has become a favorite among developers—by popular demand, we’re making it available directly in ChatGPT.

We’re actively working on further improvements. For more details, check out our blog post explaining what happened and our initial findings, and this blog post where we expand on what we missed with sycophancy and the changes we're going to make going forward.
Improvements to GPT-4o (April 25, 2025)
We’re making additional improvements to GPT-4o, optimizing when it saves memories and enhancing problem-solving capabilities for STEM. We’ve also made subtle changes to the way it responds, making it more proactive and better at guiding conversations toward productive outcomes. We think these updates help GPT-4o feel more intuitive and effective across a variety of tasks–we hope you agree!
OpenAI o3 and o4-mini (April 16, 2025)
OpenAI o3 is our most powerful reasoning model that pushes the frontier across coding, math, science, visual perception, and more. It sets a new SOTA on benchmarks including Codeforces, SWE-bench (without building a custom model-specific scaffold), and MMMU. It’s ideal for complex queries requiring multi-faceted analysis and whose answers may not be immediately obvious. It performs especially strongly at visual tasks like analyzing images, charts, and graphics. In evaluations by external experts, o3 makes 20 percent fewer major errors than OpenAI o1 on difficult, real-world tasks—especially excelling in areas like programming, business/consulting, and creative ideation. Early testers highlighted its analytical rigor as a thought partner and emphasized its ability to generate and critically evaluate novel hypotheses—particularly within biology, math, and engineering contexts.
OpenAI o4-mini is a smaller model optimized for fast, cost-efficient reasoning—it achieves remarkable performance for its size and cost, particularly in math, coding, and visual tasks. It is the best-performing benchmarked model on AIME 2024 and 2025. In expert evaluations, it also outperforms its predecessor, o3‑mini, on non-STEM tasks as well as domains like data science. Thanks to its efficiency, o4-mini supports significantly higher usage limits than o3, making it a strong high-volume, high-throughput option for questions that benefit from reasoning.
Improvements to GPT-4o (March 27, 2025)
We’ve made improvements to GPT-4o—it now feels more intuitive, creative, and collaborative, with enhanced instruction-following, smarter coding capabilities, and a clearer communication style.
Smarter problem-solving in STEM and coding:
GPT-4o has further improved its capability to tackle complex technical and coding problems. It now generates cleaner, simpler frontend code, more accurately thinks through existing code to identify necessary changes, and consistently produces coding outputs that successfully compile and run, streamlining your coding workflows.
Enhanced instruction-following and formatting accuracy:
GPT-4o is now more adept at following detailed instructions, especially for prompts containing multiple or complex requests. It improves on generating outputs according to the format requested and achieves higher accuracy in classification tasks.
“Fuzzy” improvements:
Early testers say that the model seems to better understand the implied intent behind their prompts, especially when it comes to creative and collaborative tasks. It’s also slightly more concise and clear, using fewer markdown hierarchies and emojis for responses that are easier to read, less cluttered, and more focused. We're curious to see if our users also find this to be the case.
This model is now available in ChatGPT and in the API as the newest snapshot of chatgpt-4o-latest. We plan to bring these improvements to a dated model in the API in the coming weeks.
Introducing GPT-4.5 (February, 27, 2025)
We’re releasing a research preview of GPT-4.5—our largest, and best model for chat, yet. GPT-4.5 is a step forward in scaling up pretraining and post-training. By scaling unsupervised learning, GPT-4.5 improves its ability to recognize patterns, draw connections, and generate creative insights without reasoning.
Early testing shows that interacting with GPT-4.5 feels more natural. Its broader knowledge base, improved ability to follow user intent, and greater “EQ” make it useful for tasks like improving writing, programming, and solving practical problems. We also expect it to hallucinate less.
We’re sharing GPT-4.5 as a research preview to better understand its strengths and limitations. We’re still exploring what it’s capable of and are eager to see how people use it in ways we might not have expected.
GPT-4.5 is available worldwide for users on the Pro plan in ChatGPT. Eventually this will be available to all paid plans (Plus, Pro, Teams, Enterprise, and Edu) with a ChatGPT account.
Introducing OpenAI o3-mini (January 31, 2025)
We’re excited to release o3-mini, our newest cost-efficient reasoning model optimized for coding, math, and science.
On the API, o3-mini supports Structured Outputs, function calling, developer messages, and streaming. It offers three adjustable reasoning efforts (low, medium, and high), so you can balance speed with depth for your use case.
ChatGPT Team, Pro, Plus, and Free plan users can access o3-mini starting today. Additionally, o3-mini now works with search to find up-to-date answers with links to relevant web sources. This is an early prototype as we work to integrate search across our reasoning models.In side-by-side testing, o3-mini delivered results on par with o1 at a lower latency, and outperformed o1-mini on advanced STEM tasks.
Expert evaluators preferred o3-mini’s answers 56% of the time over o1-mini’s, citing improved clarity and fewer critical errors on difficult questions. We look forward to your feedback and will keep refining o3-mini as we expand our family of advanced reasoning models.
Updates to GPT-4o in ChatGPT (January 29, 2025)
We’ve made some updates to GPT-4o–it’s now a smarter model across the board with more up-to-date knowledge, as well as deeper understanding and analysis of image uploads.
More up-to-date knowledge: By extending its training data cutoff from November 2023 to June 2024, GPT-4o can now offer more relevant, current, and contextually accurate responses, especially for questions involving cultural and social trends or more up-to-date research. A fresher training data set also makes it easier for the model to frame its web searches more efficiently and effectively.
Deeper understanding and analysis of image uploads:
GPT-4o is now better at understanding and answering questions about visual inputs, with improvements on multimodal benchmarks like MMMU and MathVista. The updated model is more adept at interpreting spatial relationships in image uploads, as well as analyzing complex diagrams, understanding charts and graphs, and connecting visual input with written content. Responses to image uploads will contain richer insights and more accurate guidance in areas like spatial planning and design layouts, as well as visually driven mathematical or technical problem-solving.
A smarter model, especially for STEM: GPT-4o is now better at math, science, and coding-related problems, with gains on academic evals like GPQA and MATH. Its improved score on MMLU—a comprehensive benchmark of language comprehension, knowledge breadth, and reasoning—reflects its ability to tackle more complex problems across domains.
Increased emoji usage ⬆️: GPT-4o is now a bit more enthusiastic in its emoji usage (perhaps particularly so if you use emoji in the conversation ✨) — let us know what you think.
Introducing GPT-4o with scheduled tasks (January 14, 2025)
Today we’re rolling out a beta version of tasks—a new way to ask ChatGPT to do things for you at a future time. Whether it's one-time reminders or recurring actions, tell ChatGPT what you need and when, and it will automatically take care of it.
Scheduled tasks is in early beta for Plus, Pro, and Teams. Eventually this will be available to anyone with a ChatGPT account.
Update to GPT-4o (November 20, 2024)
We’ve updated GPT-4o for ChatGPT users on all paid tiers. This update to GPT-4o includes improved writing capabilities that are now more natural, audience-aware, and tailored to improve relevance and readability. This model is also better at working with uploaded files, able to provide deeper insights and more thorough responses.
Update to GPT 4o-mini (November 5, 2024)
Today, we’ve updated GPT-4o mini for ChatGPT users on the Free, Plus, and Team tier, along with users that use ChatGPT while logged out.
Introducing GPT-4o with canvas (October 3, 2024)
We trained GPT-4o to collaborate as a creative partner. The model knows when to open a canvas, make targeted edits, and fully rewrite. It also understands broader context to provide precise feedback and suggestions.
Canvas is in early beta, and we plan to rapidly improve its capabilities.
Advanced voice (September 24, 2024)
Advanced voice uses GPT-4o’s native audio capabilities and features more natural, real-time conversations that pick up on non-verbal cues, such as the speed you’re talking, and can respond with emotion. Usage of advanced Voice (audio inputs and outputs) by Plus and Team users is limited on a daily basis.
Introducing OpenAI o1-preview and o1-mini (September 12, 2024)
We've developed a new series of AI models designed to spend more time thinking before they respond. They can reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science, coding, and math.
Today, we are releasing the first of this series in ChatGPT and our API. This is a preview and we expect regular updates and improvements.
ChatGPT Plus and Team users will be able to access o1 models in ChatGPT starting today. Both o1-preview and o1-mini can be selected manually in the model picker, and at launch, weekly rate limits will be 30 messages for o1-preview and 50 for o1-mini. We are working to increase those rates and enable ChatGPT to automatically choose the right model for a given prompt.

What is the canvas feature in ChatGPT and how do I use it?
Common questions about using the canvas feature in ChatGPT.
Updated over 3 weeks ago
Please note that canvas is available on Web, Windows, and MacOS. Coming soon to mobile platforms (iOS, Android, mobile web).
Canvas is a new interface for working with ChatGPT on writing and coding projects that require editing and revisions.
With canvas, ChatGPT can better understand the context of what you’re trying to accomplish. You can highlight specific sections to indicate exactly what you want ChatGPT to focus on. It can also give in-line feedback and suggestions with the entire project in mind.
You control the project in canvas. You can directly edit text or code. You can use the shortcuts to have ChatGPT to adjust writing length, debug your code, and quickly perform other useful actions. You can also restore previous versions of your work by using the back button in canvas.
Canvas is available in GPT-4o and o1. If you reach your GPT-4o / o1 limits, you will need to wait until your GPT-4o / o1 limits resets to continue using canvas.
Canvas now supports o1, our smartest model.
Canvas also now supports rendering React and HTML to create mini apps.
How do I use o1 with canvas?
You can toggle to the o1 model to use it – you can then trigger canvas by using /canvas or from the Toolbox dropdown. Canvas won’t trigger automatically in o1 yet.
How does React/HTML rendering work?
React/HTML code is rendered in a sandbox environment, allowing you to view the output of the code. All npm packages and many javascript libraries will work.
Canvas code execution and network access toggles
Please note that code execution and React/HTML rendering can result in external network requests to be made. Enterprise workspace admins can control whether canvas code execution is available for users in the workspace along with the default network access behaviors. By default, canvas code execution is turned on while Allow canvas code to access the network is turned off for enterprise workspaces but these toggles are configurable in the Admin settings of your workspace.
Accessing canvas on ChatGPT
Please note that you can no longer open a canvas by selecting GPT-4o with canvas from the model selector at the top of the page. The regenerate option is also disabled for conversations using canvas.
ChatGPT may open a canvas when it grasps what you’re trying to accomplish. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to generate a piece of writing (eg. "let’s write a long essay about why a strawberry is a pseudocarp") or draft code for you (eg. “write a web server in python”) and it will respond with a canvas. You can typically expect GPT-4o with canvas to open automatically when ChatGPT generates content greater than 10 lines or detects a scenario where it would be helpful to have an interface for writing or code. Additionally, you can include “use canvas…” in your prompt to ask ChatGPT to open canvas.
Responses with canvas will automatically open a window on the right-hand side that contains your requested content.
You can also get started with a blank canvas with ChatGPT on web by saying things like, “open a canvas”, or “open a coding canvas”. With a blank canvas, you can work on an existing project by pasting it into the blank canvas, or by just typing in the canvas.
You can also paste content into ChatGPT and instantly open it in canvas via a shortcut in the upper right corner of the composer.
Additionally, the toolbox in the prompt composer also enables you to ask ChatGPT to create a new canvas in your prompt. This can also be triggered by typing a backslash (“/”) and then using the “canvas” command.
Editing your project with canvas
You can make edits with canvas by simply asking for them in the chat. Additionally, you can select part of the content by highlighting the text or use the block comment icon to select an entire paragraph block. This will open an input where you can provide guidance on what to explain or edit in the selected section.
You can also directly edit the canvas content by clicking into the canvas and typing. Please note that only basic markdown formatting options are supported, including bold, italic, headers, bullet points, and numbered lists. We don’t currently offer more advanced formatting options in canvas.
You can get targeted comment suggestions from ChatGPT by simply selecting the Suggest edits or Review code shortcuts. By clicking on the comment bubble, you can see the specific suggestion provided by ChatGPT. You can either directly edit the flagged item and close the comment, or select Apply to have ChatGPT automatically generate content to address the comment.
When working on a writing task, you also have the option to highlight specific portions of your text or code and ask ChatGPT to either request edits to that section or ask a question about it. Formatting options can also be accessed by highlighting a piece of text. Basic markdown formatting is supported, including bold, italic, headers, bullet points, and numbered lists. We don’t currently offer more advanced formatting options in canvas.
Shortcuts on canvas for writing and coding
Canvas with ChatGPT provides access to a bundle of writing shortcuts that enable you to ask for suggested edits, adjust the length of the output, update the intended reading level, and add emojis or a final polish to your piece. To find these shortcuts, hover over the shortcuts menu on the bottom-right of the page.
For writing documents, you can use the following shortcuts:
Suggest edits: ChatGPT will add inline suggestions to improve your writing.
Adjust the length: shortens or expands the length of your document.
Change reading level: adjusts the reading level from Kindergarten to Graduate School.
Add final polish: checks for grammar, clarity, and consistency.
Add emojis: replaces words with emojis or adds them for extra emphasis and color.
For coding, you can use the following shortcuts:
Add logs: inserts print statements to assist with debugging and tracking execution.
Add comments: adds comments to explain the code and improve readability.
Fix bugs: detects and rewrites problematic code to resolve errors.
Port to a language: translates your code into languages like JavaScript, Python, Java, TypeScript, C++, or PHP.
Code review: provides inline suggestions to optimize and improve your code.
Some shortcuts will immediately update the contents of your project, like Add emojis, Add final polish, Fix bugs, and Port to a language.
Other shortcuts can be tweaked with a slider. For instance, the Adjust the length shortcut gives you the flexibility to select options between Shortest to Longest length. The Reading level shortcut enables you to adjust the reading level from Kindergarten to Graduate School.
Version history and show changes
You can navigate versions of your canvas document or code by using the version history via the arrows in the top toolbar. This allows you to see previous versions as well as restore these versions if you so choose. You can also copy the contents of your project by selecting the copy button.
Additionally, you can see changes between canvas versions by using the Show changes button at the top toolbar. This will show additions and deletions for both documents and code.
Executing Python code with canvas
You can execute code canvas files for Python directly on your browser when you are using canvas by selecting the Execute button in your canvas. When executing Python code, the output will appear in the console at the bottom of the screen. When there are errors that appear in the console, ChatGPT will provide a suggestion about the error – click the Fix bug button to have ChatGPT attempt to fix it for you!
This feature is currently only available for Python code but we plan to extend access to other programming languages in the future.
Enabling canvas for your GPT
Canvas now works with GPTs. You can enable canvas access to GPTs by enabling the canvas capability in the GPT Builder. This enables your GPT end users to open a canvas while having a chat with your GPT.
Please note that this capability is off for all existing GPTs and on by default for any newly created GPTs. You can modify this at any time in the GPT Builder.
Learn more about the GPT Builder.
Sharing a canvas with others
Sharing a canvas is available for all plans including Free, Plus, Pro, Team, Enterprise, and Edu.
Users can now share a canvas asset such as rendered React/HTML code, document, or code with another user, similar to how you share a conversation. You can do this from the canvas toolbar when canvas is open.
Downloading your canvas file
You can now export your canvas documents in multiple formats depending on the type of content. Look for the Download button in the top-right corner of your canvas to try it out.
For general documents (like essays or blog posts), canvas supports exporting to PDF, Markdown (.md) and Word (.docx) formats.
For code-based canvases, canvas intelligently detects the language and exports it in the appropriate file extension (e.g., .py, .js, .sql, etc.), preserving formatting and syntax.
This feature makes it easy to archive your work, share drafts, or continue editing in external tools.
Canvas and web safety
Canvas can preview websites and other web content. Web content is necessarily online and has the ability to communicate with third-parties that are not OpenAI.
Communication that web preview makes can be as simple as using the internet to access an image — but it can also be as dangerous as sending information you have entered or shared with ChatGPT to a third-party.
ChatGPT takes the information you provide as you talk and uses it to make informed responses. In some cases, like if you paste information from the internet, or when news or search results are retrieved, ChatGPT will use other information for its responses including in code generation with canvas.
When you interact with canvas web preview, ChatGPT will ask you to confirm communications with third-parties OpenAI doesn’t know about. If you confirm this communication, we allow the preview to communicate with that third-party.

Prompt engineering best practices for ChatGPT
Learn how to craft effective prompts to get the best out of ChatGPT
Updated over 3 months ago
This guide provides resources to help ChatGPT users craft effective prompts for high-quality responses.
What is a prompt?
A prompt for a Large Language Model (LLM) is a text input that initiates a conversation or triggers a response from the model. However, it can be in other forms such as an image or audio.
What is prompt engineering?
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing input prompts to effectively guide a language model's responses.
General best practices
Be clear and specific
Ensure your prompts are clear, specific, and provide enough context for the model to understand what you are asking. Avoid ambiguity and be as precise as possible to get accurate and relevant responses.
Iterative refinement
Prompt engineering often requires an iterative approach. Start with an initial prompt, review the response, and refine the prompt based on the output. Adjust the wording, add more context, or simplify the request as needed to improve the results.
Requesting a different tone
Use descriptive adjectives to indicate the tone. Words like formal, informal, friendly, professional, humorous, or serious can help guide the model. For instance, "Explain this in a friendly and engaging tone."
Additional Resources
We have many resources on best practices on crafting effective prompts. Though some may reference our API, the recommendations themselves are relevant for ChatGPT.

Projects in ChatGPT
Organize, revisit, and continue your work—all in one place
Updated yesterday
Note: Projects are currently available to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team, Enterprise and Edu plans worldwide.
Overview
Projects are smart workspaces that keep everything related to a long‑running effort in one place. Group together chats, upload reference files, and add custom instructions so ChatGPT remembers what matters and stays on‑topic. With memory, context, and flexible tools, they’re ideal for repeated and evolving work such as writing, research, planning, and more.
What’s new (June 2025)
Deep research – Run in-depth, multi-step research that blends your project context (chats, files, instructions) with public web sources.
Voice mode – Talk through ideas hands‑free or ask questions about an uploaded file by tapping the microphone in any project chat.
Share individual chats – Create a unique URL to share a chat from a project.
Mobile upgrades – Upload files and switch models directly from the ChatGPT app.
Mobile users will need to update their app to the latest version.
Improved project memory – Memory can reference past chats in a project to keep responses focused and on-topic. (Available for Plus/Pro users)
Seamless project creation – Turn any chat into a project from the sidebar menu or just drag a chat into the project folder.
Getting started
Creating a project
Click New project in the sidebar and give it a clear, goal‑oriented name like “Wedding Planning” or “Mobile‑App Redesign.”
Add context or files
Upload PDFs, spreadsheets, or images in Files, and add project instructions to guide tone or role (e.g., “Act like my marketing mentor”). Instructions set in your project will not interact with any chats outside of your project, and will supersede custom instructions set in your ChatGPT account. Learn more about Custom Instructions on ChatGPT.
Moving existing chats into a project
From the chat list in the left sidebar, drag any chat onto your desired project, or onto New project to create a new project. You can also click on the chat’s menu and select Move to project or Create New Project.
Once you move the chat into the project, the chat can now continue in the context of the project. This means that any Custom Instructions and files in your project will impact responses from ChatGPT for that chat.
You can remove a chat from your project by clicking on the chat’s menu and selecting Remove, or by dragging it out of the project.
Chat, research, iterate
Use your favorite ChatGPT tools right inside of a project:
Deep research - construct comprehensive reports
Image generation - for visuals that jump-start design thinking
Voice mode - for quick back‑and‑forth or hands-free Q&A
Canvas - Draft docs, code, or layouts when you need more than chat
Share - Create a unique URL to share a chat from a project
Note that this link grants access solely to the respective chat; no other project chat, files, custom instructions, and history are shared.
Deleting projects
You can delete your project by selecting the dots next to your project name and selecting Delete project. This will delete your files, chats, and custom instructions in the project. Once they are deleted, they cannot be recovered.
Plans & limits
Users can create unlimited projects.
Pro, Team, and Enterprise users can upload up to 40 files per project. Education users can upload up to 20 files per project. Plus users can upload up to 10. All uploads are subject to rate limits, and only 10 files can be uploaded at the same time.
Admin controls, data, and compliance API
Workspace-level feature controls
Projects inherit all toggles and restrictions that apply to your Team, Enterprise, or Edu workspace:
Tool availability – If Deep Research, Voice Mode, or any other feature is disabled at the workspace level, it is automatically disabled inside every Project.
Data controls – Retention windows, data-residency locations, and memory settings continue to apply without extra configuration.
Security – Projects use the same encryption, access controls, and audit logging as standard chats; no new surface area is introduced.
Note: That there is currently no way to disable projects at the workspace level.
Compliance API
The current Compliance API endpoints and behavior for chats in projects remain unchanged. For details, see the Compliance API reference.
Data Retention & Residency
All messages created in a project inherit the retention duration and residency region configured for your workspace. No separate retention policy is required, and deleted projects and their chats, files, and custom instructions are removed from our systems within 30 days unless we’re required to retain them for legal or security reasons.
For additional information on the data retention policy, please refer to our help article: Chat and File Retention Policies in ChatGPT

You can create scheduled tasks that enable ChatGPT to run automated prompts and proactively reach out to you on a scheduled basis. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to create scheduled tasks for the following:
“Can you give me a briefing on AI news each afternoon?”
“Practice French with me daily”
“Remind me about my mom’s birthday”
Please note the following details:
Scheduled tasks are supported on ChatGPT Web, iOS, Android, MacOS.
Scheduled tasks on the Windows app is on the roadmap and coming soon.
Scheduled tasks gives ChatGPT the ability to create tasks for itself to run later.
Tasks can be triggered either at specific times (one-off or recurring) or via API.
These tasks are executed regardless of whether the user is currently online.
Users are sent push notifications or emails when the task is complete.
Setting up a task
If this is your first time setting up a task, you can select one of our suggested tasks or click on Try your own to set up a scheduled task:
You can also create a new task by asking ChatGPT. You’ll first need to select o3 or o4-mini from the dropdown menu on the top of the screen. Then, ask ChatGPT to create a task like “Remind me about my mom’s birthday on March 13th”.
Once you submit your task to ChatGPT, you’ll be provided with the following confirmation:
If you need to disable or enable notifications on any of the mobile or desktop apps, you can do so from your Notifications settings on ChatGPT Web including Push notifications, Email, or both.
Please note that you may need to update additional browser settings to enable Desktop notifications. If we detect that the necessary permissions are not enabled, you will see the following notice in your conversation:
Once you click Allow, your browser may provide a notification to enable necessary permissions. On Chrome, you will see the following:
If you would like to receive mobile push notifications on iOS or Android, try creating a task on your mobile device by selecting o3 and o4-mini. Then, after you have created your first scheduled task, ChatGPT will ask you for notification permissions.

Deep Research FAQ
Updated over a week ago
What is deep research?
Deep research is a specialized AI capability designed to perform in-depth, multi-step research using data on the public web. It’s fine-tuned on the OpenAI o3 reasoning model and can autonomously search for and read information from diverse online sources. This enables it to create thorough, documented, and clearly cited reports on complex topics.
What kind of tasks should I use deep research for?
Deep research is perfect for people who do intense knowledge work in areas like finance, science, and law, as well as researchers and discerning shoppers who need thorough, precise, and reliable research. Every output is fully documented, with clear citations to sources, making it easy to verify and reference the information. Deep research is particularly effective at finding niche, non-intuitive information that would involve multiple steps across numerous websites.
What are the usage limits for deep research?
ChatGPT users have access to the following deep research usage:
Free – 5 tasks/month using the lightweight version
Plus, Team, Enterprise, Edu – 10 tasks/month, plus an additional 15 tasks/month using the lightweight version
Pro – 125 tasks/month, plus an additional 125/month using the lightweight version
Once Plus, Pro, and Team users reach their monthly limit with the standard deep research model, additional requests will automatically use a lightweight, cost-effective version until the monthly limit resets.
When do my limits reset?
Your limits reset every 30 days. The first time you use deep research, a 30-day usage window begins. Your limit then resets every 30 days from that point forward. The 30-day usage window of the subscription carries over even after switching to a different plan.
How do I use deep research?
In ChatGPT, select ‘Deep research’ when typing in your query. Tell ChatGPT what you need—whether it’s a comprehensive competitive analysis or a personalized report on the best commuter bike that meets your specific requirements. You can attach images, files, or spreadsheets to add context to your question. Deep research may sometimes generate a form to capture specific parameters of your question before it starts researching so it can create a more focused and relevant report.
Once it starts running, a sidebar appears with a summary of the model’s thought process and websites it’s visiting to find relevant information. Deep research may take anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes to complete its work. Unlike a traditional chatbot exchange, it works in the background, diving into web searches, reading through text, PDFs, images, and more, then synthesizing results.
The final output arrives as a report within the chat – in the next few weeks, we will also be adding embedded images, data visualizations, and other analytic outputs in these reports for additional clarity and context.
How long does each research task take?
Deep research typically completes a query within 5 to 30 minutes, depending on its complexity. For shorter, real-time conversations or simpler queries, you might prefer using GPT-4o (with or without Search), which responds almost instantly.
What if I only need a quick answer?
If you just need a short response or a casual conversation, deep research is likely not necessary. Deep research shines in complicated, multi-layered inquiries requiring data from across the web.
How does deep research differ from search?
Deep research and search in ChatGPT are designed for different types of tasks. Search is great for quick, interactive real-time answers, like checking the news, weather, or sports scores. It pulls information from the web and gives you a brief summary with links to sources. Deep research, on the other hand, is built for more complex tasks that require greater depth and thoroughness. It searches through hundreds of sources, analyzes the information, and puts together a detailed report with citations and data.
In short, traditional “search” can help you look up information and will give you fast, concise answers in seconds while deep research will deliberately take more time (ranging anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes) to deliver a thorough, well-documented, and complete response. As a simple heuristic:
Use search when you need quick facts or to look up something
Use deep research when you need in-depth analysis or something beyond the surface level
Does deep research cite its sources?
Yes, the output from deep research includes clearly labeled citations or source links. This enables you to better understand where information is coming from, fact check, or track down details as needed.
What data does deep research have access to?
Currently, deep research can access the open web and any uploaded files, but is not able to access private data sources (e.g., subscription-based sources, internal resources). We look forward to making this type of data available to deep research in the near future!

ChatGPT generated links
Assessing links that ChatGPT generates for you
Updated this week
📞 Try our AI voice help experiment! (U.S. and Canada only)
Call 1-888-GPT-0090 to help answer your general questions about ChatGPT and other OpenAI products. Calls may be used to improve OpenAI's services. Learn more.
In its goal of being a helpful assistant, ChatGPT takes the information you provide as you talk and uses it to create informed responses to your questions. This can also include information it retrieves from online sources such as news or search results.
For example, if you ask ChatGPT “Where do I find cars to buy in my area?”, it might send you a blue hyperlink to https://example.com/car\_search/London, knowing that you live in London. Visiting this link could help you find the car you want, but it also transmits the information that you live in London to the car search service.
ChatGPT provides these links with the goal of helping the user, but it’s also possible for a third party to lie to it or insert malicious instructions to it. In these cases, clicking these links can transmit information you would not want transmitted to third-parties.
To keep you in control of how your data is shared, the ChatGPT app will ask you to approve certain links before they can be visited. Be cautious with who you trust with your data, and review the website that the link is going to and make sure you trust it (e.g. https://chatgpt.com, https://openai.com …).

Codex in ChatGPT
Frequently asked questions about using Codex in ChatGPT.
Updated over a week ago
Codex in ChatGPT to is available to users on Plus, Pro, Team, Enterprise, and Edu plans.
For the full technical user guide, see https://platform.openai.com/docs/codex.
For information about the Codex CLI / Sign in with ChatGPT see Codex CLI and Sign in with ChatGPT.
For ChatGPT Enterprise admins see our Admin getting started guide.
Overview
What is Codex in ChatGPT?
Codex is OpenAI’s cloud-based software engineering agent—purpose-built to support professional developers by securely connecting to your codebase and automating tasks like bug fixing, feature development, test generation, and more. It runs tasks in parallel in the cloud, so engineers stay focused while Codex handles the rest.
How workspace admins can turn Codex ON
In your ChatGPT workspace settings at https://chatgpt.com/admin/settings under Codex toggle Allow members to use Codex to ON.
Security / training / privacy
How can Enterprise admins feel confident about security when they enable Codex workspace-wide during the research preview?
Every Codex task runs in its own ephemeral container, created using your environment settings. During container setup, internet access is available so that you can install dependencies.
After the setup phase, the Codex agent gets access to the container and starts working on its task. As the workspace admin, you control whether the container has network access while the agent does its task. If you choose to disable network access while the agent does its task, all outbound traffic is blocked.
When the agent is done, you are presented with the diff produced by the agent, for review before merging the changes into your codebase. Additionally, you can inspect the agent's work log. The work log contains every command run by the agent.
ChatGPT access to Codex is turned OFF unless a workspace admin manually toggles Codex ON for the workspace.
The GitHub token is scoped only to the repo the admin connects.
Do you train your models based on my usage of Codex?
For ChatGPT Team, ChatGPT Enterprise, and ChatGPT Edu users, we do not train models on your Codex content, consistent with our Enterprise privacy commitments.
For users on all other plans, model training depends on the "Improve the model for everyone" setting in ChatGPT. If this setting is on, your tasks can be used to improve our models.
There is an additional setting in Codex that allows you to enable training on your complete environments, including the connected repos. It is off by default for all environments.
