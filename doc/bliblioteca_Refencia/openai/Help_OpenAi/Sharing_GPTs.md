Building and publishing a GPT
Information on how to build and publish GPTs in the store
Updated over 2 months ago
Who can publish GPTs?
To publish a GPT to the public GPT Store:
You must be a ChatGPT Plus or Pro subscriber or part of an Enterprise workspace with GPT creation enabled.
Free-tier users can use GPTs, but cannot create or publish them.
Enterprise admins can control access to GPT creation via workspace settings.
Setting up your Builder Profile
Before publishing your GPT publicly, you’ll need to verify your Builder Profile.
You can verify in one of two ways:
Option 1: Name Verification
Your builder name will match the name on your ChatGPT Plus billing profile.
You’ll see your name under Settings > Builder Profile.
Toggle on “Show your name” if you want it displayed with your GPT.
Option 2: Domain Verification
Navigate to Settings > Builder Profile.
Under “Links,” click Verify new domain.
Enter your domain (e.g., yourcompany.com) and follow the instructions to add a DNS TXT record.
Once verified, you can show your domain instead of your personal name (e.g., "by yourcompany.com").
You can only attach one verified domain per Builder Profile.
(Optional) Link social profiles
You can connect your Twitter, GitHub, or LinkedIn account to your Builder Profile for extra credibility. These links will display as icons on your GPTs in the Store.
Creating your GPT
In the ChatGPT app or at chat.openai.com/gpts/editor:
Click Explore GPTs > Create.
Give your GPT a name, description, and personality.
Optionally add:
A profile image
Custom instructions
Tools like web browsing, file uploads, or API actions
If your GPT uses a custom action that calls an external API, you must verify the domain and include a Privacy Policy URL.
Publishing your GPT
Once your GPT is ready:
Click Share or Publish.
Choose your visibility:
Private: Only visible to you
Anyone with link: Unlisted, shareable via URL
Everyone: Listed in the GPT Store (requires verified Builder Profile)
Select a category (e.g. Productivity, Education).
Review how your name or domain will appear.
Click Publish to submit your GPT.
Review and approval process
Every GPT is reviewed before appearing in the Store. This includes:
Automated policy checks
Possible manual review if flagged
Most GPTs appear in the Store within minutes. Some may take longer depending on content and review load.
Managing your GPT
You can:
Edit your GPT at any time
Unpublish it by switching visibility to Private or Link-only
View usage analytics from the “My GPTs” dashboard
If a GPT is delisted for policy reasons, you’ll receive an email and may be able to appeal directly in the builder interface.
Receiving feedback
If you enable “Receive feedback emails” in your Builder Profile:
Users can send feedback about your GPT.
You’ll receive notifications at the email tied to your ChatGPT account.
You can disable feedback emails anytime from Builder Profile settings.
Policies and restrictions
Published GPTs must follow:
OpenAI Usage Policies
GPT Brand Guidelines
Privacy & Safety Guidelines
Restricted:
Impersonating real individuals or entities
Using copyrighted names, logos, or likenesses without authorization
GPTs designed to generate disallowed content
Violations may lead to takedown, account warnings, or removal from the Store.

How to appeal a GPT restricted from sharing
Updated over a year ago
We may prevent GPTs from being published or remove GPTs from the store that violates our brand guidelines or usage policies.
If your GPT has been restricted from sharing, you can still edit it to make it compliant with our guidelines, and attempt to publish it again.
Alternatively, you can appeal the decision.
After clicking Appeal, you’ll be prompted to provide a reason why your GPT doesn’t violate our policies and should be shared.
After you click Submit, you won’t be able to edit your GPT until it’s reviewed internally or if you choose to cancel your appeal.
You may still be able to use your GPT privately.
Upon review, you’ll receive a notification to the email associated with your ChatGPT account the GPT belongs to.
If your appeal is approved, you’ll receive instructions for how to update your sharing settings to publish your GPT.
If your appeal is denied, you’ll be encouraged to edit your GPT to ensure it’s compliant with our policies or submit another appeal.
In the “Save” dropdown of the GPT editor, you’ll be able to see an Appeal button:
We do not yet guarantee a timeline for the manual review of your appeal.

How to share GPTs within workspaces
Updated over 3 months ago
It’s now possible to share GPTs with individual users and groups within your workspace.
How do I share a GPT in my workspace?
You can share GPTs with specific users in your Team or Enterprise workspace. In the GPT Editor, you’ll see a new “Share” button.
This button will open the "Share GPT" modal. You’ll be able to search for people in your workspace. If no names appear, the user may not be a member of your workspace. You can view members from the admin page.
A user will receive an email notification containing a link to the GPT you’ve invited them to collaborate on.
To give your entire workspace access, you can select “Anyone at My Team with the link”. You can also publish to your workspace, which will allow the GPT to show up in your workspace’s section within the Explore GPTs page.
If you wish to share your team’s GPT publicly, you can either share a GPT to “Anyone with the link”, which will allow anyone with the link to chat with the GPT, or you can “Publish to the GPT Store”. This will only be available if allowed by the Enterprise settings. If any of the settings above are greyed out, please note that this is likely due to the Enterprise-level workspace configuration.
What sharing settings are available?
After adding a user to invite, you’ll be able select what permissions they should have. Currently, we support the following:
​
1. "Can chat" - allows a user to chat with the GPT
2. "Can view settings" - allows a user to view configuration settings, duplicate, and chat with the GPT
3. "Can edit" - allows a user to edit configuration settings, duplicate, and chat with the GPT
The "view settings" permission can be used if you’d like others to be able to see how you made the GPT, as well as duplicate it and use it as a starting point for GPTs of their own. Note that users who can view the configuration of your GPT will be able to duplicate the full configuration (including attached files for knowledge) except for API keys / OAuth client secrets.
​
Can I invite people outside of my workspace to collaborate on a GPT?
No, only people who have an active seat in your workspace will be able to receive invitations to collaboration on GPTs.
​
​Can Enterprise Admins limit GPT sharing options for their workspaces?
​
Under https://chatgpt.com/admin/gpts -> GPTs, you have a few sharing options which can restrict the sharing settings available to the workspace members. Please refer to Managing GPTs page for details.
