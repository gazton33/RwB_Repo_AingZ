Developer quickstart
====================
Take your first steps with the OpenAI API.
The OpenAI API provides a simple interface to state-of-the-art AI [models](/docs/models) for text generation, natural language processing, computer vision, and more. This example generates [text output](/docs/guides/text) from a prompt, as you might using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com).
Generate text from a model
```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();
const response = await client.responses.create({
model: "gpt-4.1",
input: "Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
});
console.log(response.output\_text);
```
```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()
response = client.responses.create(
model="gpt-4.1",
input="Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
)
print(response.output\_text)
```
```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI\_API\_KEY" \
-d '{
"model": "gpt-4.1",
"input": "Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
}'
```
Data retention for model responses
Response objects are saved for 30 days by default. They can be viewed in the dashboard [logs](/logs?api=responses) page or [retrieved](/docs/api-reference/responses/get) via the API. You can disable this behavior by setting `store` to `false` when creating a Response.
OpenAI does not use data sent via API to train our models without your explicit consent—[learn more](/docs/guides/your-data).

Analyze image inputs
--------------------
You can provide image inputs to the model as well. Scan receipts, analyze screenshots, or find objects in the real world with [computer vision](/docs/guides/images).
Analyze the content of an image
```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();
const response = await client.responses.create({
model: "gpt-4.1",
input: [
{ role: "user", content: "What two teams are playing in this photo?" },
{
role: "user",
content: [
{
type: "input\_image",
image\_url: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/LeBron\_James\_Layup\_%28Cleveland\_vs\_Brooklyn\_2018%29.jpg",
}
],
},
],
});
console.log(response.output\_text);
```
```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI\_API\_KEY" \
-d '{
"model": "gpt-4.1",
"input": [
{
"role": "user",
"content": "What two teams are playing in this photo?"
},
{
"role": "user",
"content": [
{
"type": "input\_image",
"image\_url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/LeBron\_James\_Layup\_%28Cleveland\_vs\_Brooklyn\_2018%29.jpg"
}
]
}
]
}'
```
```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()
response = client.responses.create(
model="gpt-4.1",
input=[
{"role": "user", "content": "what teams are playing in this image?"},
{
"role": "user",
"content": [
{
"type": "input\_image",
"image\_url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/LeBron\_James\_Layup\_%28Cleveland\_vs\_Brooklyn\_2018%29.jpg"
}
]
}
]
)
print(response.output\_text)
```

](/docs/guides/images)
Extend the model with tools
---------------------------
Give the model access to new data and capabilities using [tools](/docs/guides/tools). You can either call your own [custom code](/docs/guides/function-calling), or use one of OpenAI's [powerful built-in tools](/docs/guides/tools). This example uses [web search](/docs/guides/tools-web-search) to give the model access to the latest information on the Internet.
Get information for the response from the Internet
```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();
const response = await client.responses.create({
model: "gpt-4.1",
tools: [ { type: "web\_search\_preview" } ],
input: "What was a positive news story from today?",
});
console.log(response.output\_text);
```
```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()
response = client.responses.create(
model="gpt-4.1",
tools=[{"type": "web\_search\_preview"}],
input="What was a positive news story from today?"
)
print(response.output\_text)
```
```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI\_API\_KEY" \
-d '{
"model": "gpt-4.1",
"tools": [{"type": "web\_search\_preview"}],
"input": "what was a positive news story from today?"
}'

Deliver blazing fast AI experiences
-----------------------------------
Using either the new [Realtime API](/docs/guides/realtime) or server-sent [streaming events](/docs/guides/streaming-responses), you can build high performance, low-latency experiences for your users.
Stream server-sent events from the API
```javascript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();
const stream = await client.responses.create({
model: "gpt-4.1",
input: [
{
role: "user",
content: "Say 'double bubble bath' ten times fast.",
},
],
stream: true,
});
for await (const event of stream) {
console.log(event);
}
```
```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()
stream = client.responses.create(
model="gpt-4.1",
input=[
{
"role": "user",
"content": "Say 'double bubble bath' ten times fast.",
},
],
stream=True,
)
for event in stream:
print(event)
```
[
Use streaming events
Use server-sent events to stream model responses to users fast.
](/docs/guides/streaming-responses)[
Get started with the Realtime API
Use WebRTC or WebSockets for super fast speech-to-speech AI apps.
](/docs/guides/realtime)
Build agents
------------
Use the OpenAI platform to build [agents](/docs/guides/agents) capable of taking action—like [controlling computers](/docs/guides/tools-computer-use)—on behalf of your users. Use the Agents SDK for [Python](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python) or [TypeScript](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-js) to create orchestration logic on the backend.
Build a language triage agent
```javascript
import { Agent, run } from '@openai/agents';
const spanishAgent = new Agent({
name: 'Spanish agent',
instructions: 'You only speak Spanish.',
});
const englishAgent = new Agent({
name: 'English agent',
instructions: 'You only speak English',
});
const triageAgent = new Agent({
name: 'Triage agent',
instructions:
'Handoff to the appropriate agent based on the language of the request.',
handoffs: [spanishAgent, englishAgent],
});
const result = await run(triageAgent, 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?');
console.log(result.finalOutput);
```
```python
from agents import Agent, Runner
import asyncio
spanish\_agent = Agent(
name="Spanish agent",
instructions="You only speak Spanish.",
)
english\_agent = Agent(
name="English agent",
instructions="You only speak English",
)
triage\_agent = Agent(
name="Triage agent",
instructions="Handoff to the appropriate agent based on the language of the request.",
handoffs=[spanish\_agent, english\_agent],
)
async def main():
result = await Runner.run(triage\_agent, input="Hola, ¿cómo estás?")
print(result.final\_output)
if \_\_name\_\_ == "\_\_main\_\_":
asyncio.run(main())

Libraries
=========
Set up your development environment to use the OpenAI API with an SDK in your preferred language.
This page covers setting up your local development environment to use the [OpenAI API](/docs/api-reference). You can use one of our officially supported SDKs, a community library, or your own preferred HTTP client.
Create and export an API key
----------------------------
Before you begin, [create an API key in the dashboard](/api-keys), which you'll use to securely [access the API](/docs/api-reference/authentication). Store the key in a safe location, like a [`.zshrc` file](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-do-zsh-configuration-files-work/) or another text file on your computer. Once you've generated an API key, export it as an [environment variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment\_variable) in your terminal.
macOS / Linux
Export an environment variable on macOS or Linux systems
```bash
export OPENAI\_API\_KEY="your\_api\_key\_here"
```
Windows
Export an environment variable in PowerShell
```bash
setx OPENAI\_API\_KEY "your\_api\_key\_here"
```
OpenAI SDKs are configured to automatically read your API key from the system environment.
Install an official SDK
-----------------------
JavaScript
To use the OpenAI API in server-side JavaScript environments like Node.js, Deno, or Bun, you can use the official [OpenAI SDK for TypeScript and JavaScript](https://github.com/openai/openai-node). Get started by installing the SDK using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or your preferred package manager:
Install the OpenAI SDK with npm
```bash
npm install openai
```
With the OpenAI SDK installed, create a file called `example.mjs` and copy the example code into it:
Test a basic API request
```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();
const response = await client.responses.create({
model: "gpt-4.1",
input: "Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
});
console.log(response.output\_text);
```
Execute the code with `node example.mjs` (or the equivalent command for Deno or Bun). In a few moments, you should see the output of your API request.

```bash
pip install openai
```
With the OpenAI SDK installed, create a file called `example.py` and copy the example code into it:
Test a basic API request
```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()
response = client.responses.create(
model="gpt-4.1",
input="Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
)
print(response.output\_text)
```
Execute the code with `python example.py`. In a few moments, you should see the output of your API request.
